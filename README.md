# Objectives

- Import the data into a MySQL database
- Analysis using simple queries
- Analysis using complex queries

# Dataset

The dataset is a subset of the Stack Overflow data dump from 2008 to 2010. I have already imported the data into a MySQL database. The file is available on Canvas.

# User Selection

Using your student ID, set the seed on `np.random`. There are 299,397 users in the dataset. Use the `np.random.randint` function to select 4200 users.

# Becoming Familair with the Data

For the first part of the assignment, you should familiarize yourself with the schema of the dataset so that you can write correct queries. For each of the questions below, you should provide the query that you used to answer the question along with a description of the query.

- How many questions are in your subset of the data?
- How many answers are in your subset of the data?
- What is the most popular tag in your subset of the data?
- What is the average reputation of users in your subset of the data?
- How many unanswered questions are in your subset of the data?

#  Analysis

For the second part of the assignment, you will conduct a series of analyses using the dataset. For each of the questions below, you should provide the query that you used to answer the question along with a description of the query. You should also provide a visualization of the results where applicable. You can use any visualization library that you would like, and the quality of your visualizations will be considered in your grade.




In your notebook file, each section of code should be preceded by a text cell that describes what the code is doing. The code should be formatted cleanly and easy to read.
